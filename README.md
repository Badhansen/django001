To contribute or run this project, follow the steps below:
### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Badhansen/django001.git
```

### 2. Create your own virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Virtual environments are where dependencies are stored, similar to `node_modules` in JavaScript. Every time you start your machine, you must activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`.

*Here are some useful links that I used to create this project*
- [Install pyenv](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac) alternative to `venv` Virtual Environments.
- [Managing pyenv, virtualenv, and pyenv-virtualenv](https://gist.github.com/Badhansen/19100e5548ef154360361ab7f45c183f), this link help me a lot managing all environment and django projects.
- [Interested in pyenv read this as well](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.
